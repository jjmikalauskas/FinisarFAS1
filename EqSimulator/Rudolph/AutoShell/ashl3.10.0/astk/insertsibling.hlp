Inseting a Sibling node

A sibling node will be that one that resides in the same level and path location as the current one. A generic name and a null value will be assigned and can be modified by editing the new node.

To insert a sibling node the option under "Edit/Insert Sibling Item" from the main menu can be used, as well as by right clicking the mouse.
